# TelegramBot
Here will come a small python package to interact with telegram. It resulted from a small Raspberr-Pi project and the objective is to easily revceive and send messages to RPI which can be interpretated by Python.   
Very helpfull for me to maintain headless RPIs. 
Not comparable to the *telegram* package.
